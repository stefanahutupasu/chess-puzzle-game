# Chess Puzzle Thesis Project

This repository contains the source code for the technical part of my thesis, titled "Developing an Engaging Chess Puzzle using Design Patterns". This project was undertaken as part of my final year of the Computer Science Bachelor Degree program at Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj Napoca. The project focuses on creating an interactive chess puzzle application that showcases the practical implementation of design patterns in game development.

## About

This thesis project explores the intersection of chess puzzles, game development, and design patterns. The project aims to create an interactive chess puzzle application that leverages various design patterns to enhance the user experience and showcase their relevance in game development.

## Features

- Interactive chess puzzle interface.
- Implementation of various design patterns to optimize code structure.
- Integration of chess puzzle solutions and game mechanics.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Installation

The game itself can be accessed through GitHub Pages, at https://stefanahutupasu.github.io/chess-puzzle-game/. Simply visit the provided link in your web browser to start play the game. No additional installation steps are required.

## Usage

- **Generate New Puzzle**: Clicking this button will generate a new chess puzzle for you to solve.

- **Interact with Pieces**: To make a move, click on a piece and then drag and drop it to the desired square. Valid moves will be highlighted as you interact with the pieces.

- **Show Hint**: If you find yourself stuck, you can click the "Show Hint" button. This will highlight the piece that should be moved next, providing a helpful clue.

- **Reset Score**: The "Reset Score" button allows you to reset the score, which keeps track of the number of solved puzzles. This score is retained using session storage, so you can track your progress over time.
